# stop_start_instances  
## Automate the start and stop of EC2 instances to optimize costs using Terraform, Lambda & Eventbridge  

### Lambda runs the actual python functions that start and stop instances, while Eventbridge sets a schedule and triggers the Lambda functions at specified times. With a focus on automation and intelligent strategies, you can effectively reduce AWS expenditure without compromising performance or functionality.

## Prerequisites
### - An AWS account
